# Trac20

A proposal for a gasless p2p token standard on Trac Network. See /contract/contract.js and /contract/protocol.js.

Trac20 defines the most simplistic token standard possible and can be operated in terminal (no special transactions required).

Inter-contract interaction can be achieved through the use of Trac Features (e.g. for marketplaces).

This contract is instantly executable, see instructions below.

## Install

Make sure to have git and node installed.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Trac-Systems/trac20.git
```

```js
cd trac20
npm install -g pear
npm install
pear run . store1
```

Use the commands in the Trac20 section to deploy, mint, transfer.

Chat system is enabled.

To enable log output in the terminal (what's minting), set the following to true in the index.js:

peer_opts.enable_logs = true;
peer_opts.enable_txlogs = false;
