# Contract Example

Contracts on Trac Network are infrastructure. 

This means that either each participant executes contracts in distributed apps (embedded contracts).
Alternatively a group of Peers (nodes) may accept transactions from external wallets to offer a web3 experience.

The most important files to check out and learn how everything works are:

- **/contract/protocol.js**: defines the framework for the contract.
- **/contract/contract.js**: the actual contract.
- **/features/timer/index.js**: a Feature (aka oracle) for the contract
- **/desktop/index.html** and **/desktop/index.js**: to learn running in desktop mode (see bottom notes)
- **/index.js**: the setup for the contract app that everyone uses (the entire package represents an app)

Release 1 (R1) must be used alongside Trac Network R1 releases to maintain contract consistency.

Trac Apps utilizes the [Pear Runtime and Holepunch](https://pears.com/).

## Install

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Trac-Systems/trac-contract-example.git
```

## Usage

While the Trac apps support native node-js, it is encouraged to use Pear:

```js
cd trac-contract-example
npm install -g pear
npm install
pear run . store1
```

**Deploy Bootstrap (admin):**

- Choose option 1)
- Copy and backup the seedphrase
- Copy the "Peer Writer" key from the Peer section
- With a text editor, open the file index.js in document root
- Replace the bootstrap address in the example section (not the MSB) with the copied writer address
- Choose a channel name (exactly 32 characters)
- Run again: pear run . store1
- After the options appear, type "/add_admin --address ababab..." and hit enter
- Your instance is now the Bootstrap and admin peer of your contract network.
- Keep your bootstrap node running
- For production contracts, it is strongly recommended to add a couple of indexers. See below.

**Running indexers (admin)**

- Install on different machines than the Bootstrap's (ideally different data centers) with the exact setup in index.js
- Upon start ("pear run . store1") copy the "Peer Writer" key
- In the Bootstrap node screen, add the indexer: "/add_indexer --key adfadf..."
- You should see a success confirmation
- Usually 2 indexers on different locations are enough, we recommend 2 to max. 4 in addition to the Bootstrap

**Enable others to join and to transact:**

- By default, people cannot auto-join the contract network. The network admin (the Bootstrap in this case) can enable auto-join
- To enable auto-join, in the screen of the Bootstrap enter "/set_auto_add_writers --enabled 1"
- Any other Peer joining with the exact same setup can join the network and execute contract functions and transactions.
- Users may join using the exact same setup in index.js and start using "pear run . store1"
- For more features, play around with the evailable system and chat options.

# App3 (Desktop)
- To see some magic, edit the package.json and edit the following fields:
- **"main": "index.js"** to **"main": "desktop/index.html"**
- In the "pear" section **"type": "terminal"** to **"type": "desktop"**
- Run: pear run -d . store1
- Wait for the app to load. -d starts the developer console. Check the console output.
- Note: mobile app deployment is in the works by the team.

# Web3
If your contract is not supposed to run as user-installable app, you can run it as server instead.
There is no special setup required other than exposing the Protocol api to your services.

To allow signers with webwallets to submit transactions through your server, enable the transaction API.
For chat messages, accordingly. See below.

Note: Trac Network mainnet is not released yet and there are no web wallets at this moment. 
But you may create an identity wallet to sign off transactions for web3 apps. 
We recommend to use the library ["micro-key-producer/slip10.js"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micro-key-producer) package for this (using ed25519 keys).

You can find all built-in api functions in trac-peer/src/api.js
Custom api functions (per-app) can be found in /contract/protocol.js and vary by the different app projects.

```js
peer_opts.api_tx_exposed = true;
peer_opts.api_msg_exposed = true;
```
